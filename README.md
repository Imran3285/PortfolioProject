# Lemonade Sales & Weather Project

This is a little sample data project I completed as part of my internship at **Victoria Solutions**.  
The idea is simple: hot and sunny days = more lemonade sold. I built a dataset, ran some analysis, and used Python to show the patterns.

---

# What I Did
- Created a **sample weekly dataset** with temperature, sunshine, and daily sales.
- Explored the data with **charts and stats**.
- Checked the **correlation** between temperature and sales.
- Built a **simple regression model** to predict sales from temperature.
- Shared **business insights** like stocking more on hot sunny weekends.

---

# Key Insights
- Sales rise as the temperature goes up.  
- Sunny days have higher sales than cloudy days.    
- A shop could use **weather forecasts** to plan stock and staffing better.  

---

# Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for charts
- **Scikit-learn** for regression
- **Jupyter/Colab Notebook**

---

# How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lemonade-sales-analysis.git
   
2. Open the notebook (.ipynb) in Jupyter or Google Colab.

3. Run the cells to see the analysis and charts
